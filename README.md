# Projet 1A 2025-2026

## Goal

This student project aims to visualize differents sports statistics and allow its user to easily find data on differents sports related to athletes, teams, etc. 

## Usage

Install the necessary dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

Run the CLI app with `python __main__.py`


## Test

Depending on your installation, run one of these commands:
`python -m pytest --cov`
`conda run pytest --cov`
`pytest --cov`

# Notes for students

Miscellaneous things of note and advice for your project

- The code and its documentation are in English! This will have you practice a bit, English is key in IT. You may code in English or French (Or another language if you're _really_ adventurous), but do not mix them: Choose one and stick with it throughout the project.

- There's an `__init__.py` in every folder. They can be used for more advanced stuff, but you'll notice in that case that they're all empty; they're mostly here to ensure the Python compiler recognizes the contents of the folder as a **package** and is able to import them

- This project features the three "modes" of data analysis:

  - The analysis with helpers libraries (here, `pandas`) with a Jupyter Notebook
  - The analysis with helpers libraries with a CLI (`Command Line Interface`) app
  - The analysis with 'homemade' tools with the same CLI app
    - Only the third one is mandatory, you may choose between CLI and Notebook for the library-backed analysis based on your preference

- Note the sparse use of classes/objects. They're useful to pass formatted data around the app, and for display purposes with the interface; you probably won't have to use them for more than this in the context of this project. They're even less required when using `pandas`; you'll mostly pass raw data around in the form of dataframes/series.

- Pay attention to the structure of the project:
  - The sub-packages rarely import each other. They're as much as possible standalone and independent. The `__main__.py` is where everything is tied together. This helps write maintainable and easily testable code.
  - Methods that interact with the files (e.g. the readers for the `.csv` files) should never be unit-tested with real data (Think about the overhead in performance! Tests should be near-instantaneous). You'll notice test files with data that mimics the real data.
